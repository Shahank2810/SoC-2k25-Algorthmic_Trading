📈 Algorithmic Trading in Python
This project is my ongoing exploration of algorithmic trading using Python. It simulates a trading environment where I can build strategies, test their behavior, and better understand the mechanics behind how trading systems work in real life.

🧠 What I’ve Learned So Far

🏗️ Building Blocks of a Trading System
I’ve written core components like Order, Trade, and OrderBook using object-oriented Python.

This helped me understand how exchanges handle bids and asks, and how real-time matching works internally.

Implementing an order book from scratch gave me a hands-on understanding of market microstructure and order flow.

⚖️ Order Matching and Execution Logic
I learned how trades are matched either within the order book or through external simulated market activity.

I now appreciate how even small changes in execution logic can affect trade outcomes, slippage, and performance.

📉 Risk Management is Non-Negotiable
I implemented position limits and experimented with stop-loss and take-profit mechanisms.

I learned that profitability without risk controls is fragile — one bad trade can undo an entire strategy.

🧪 Strategy Design and Evaluation
I explored several basic strategies:

Mean Reversion

Momentum

Market Making

Breakout & Z-Score

Bollinger Bands

RSI-based decisions

Each strategy taught me something different about timing, signal noise, and how important it is to test in multiple conditions.

I also began to notice overfitting patterns — strategies that work only on the past data but fall apart elsewhere.

🛠️ Modular Thinking with Python
Using Python classes for each component forced me to write clean, modular, and reusable code.

I now think more in terms of how different parts of a system communicate: strategy → order → execution → trade → position.

📊 The Gap Between Theory and Practice
While backtests were helpful, I saw firsthand how easy it is to over-tune a strategy to the past.

I’m learning to focus more on robustness than just profit curves.
